Building Meazure From Source
----------------------------

Meazure is a Microsoft Windows program and must be built on Windows. These
instructions describe how to build Meazure for 32-bits on Microsoft Windows
XP SP3 using Visual C++ Express 2010, which is the a freely available
configuration. I have also built Meazure using Visual Studio 2008. I invite
others to augment these instructions for building on other versions of Windows.

1. Download and install Visual C++ Express 2010 from
   http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express

2. Meazure is an MFC application but Visual C++ Express does provide the MFC
   libraries. To obtain the MFC development package, download and install the
   Windows Driver Kit (WINDDK) 7.1.0 from
   http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=11800.

3. Edit the file C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\inc\mfc42\atlconv.h and change line 7 to:

    #include "..\atl71\atlconv.h"

4. Edit the file C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\inc\mfc42\atldef.h and change line 4 to:

    #include "..\atl71\atldef.h"

5. Download and install CMake from http://www.cmake.org/. Ensure that the
   cmake program is in your path.

6. Download and install Python from http://www.python.org/download/

7. Download and install Inno Setup from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php and
   add "C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 5" to the PATH

8. Download and install the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms669985%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

9. Download and install Doxygen from http://wwww.doxygen.org

10. Download and install Graphviz from http://www.graphviz.org/

11. Download and install MiKTEX from http://miktex.org/

12. Meazure uses the Boost library including the date_time module. While there
    are many ways to obtain Boost, It is best to build boost from source.

    a. Download the latest Boost from http://www.boost.org

    b. Unpack the archive into the directory C:\Program Files\boost

    c. At the root of the boost source directory run the command: bootstrap.bat

    d. Run the command: b2 --toolset=msvc-10.0 --build-type=complete stage

    e. Wait a long time while Boost builds...

13. Once Boost has built, record its installation root directory
    (e.g. C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_47_0) and set the environment
    variable BOOST_ROOT with that path. If you have built a version of Boost
    newer than 1.47.0, you need to edit Meazure's top level CMakeLists.txt
    file and change the line:

    set(Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS "1.47" "1.47.0")

    to include the version of Boost that you have built. For example, if you
    have built version 1.50.0, the line becomes:

    set(Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS "1.47" "1.47.0" "1.50" "1.50.0")

14. Open Visual C++ Express 2010 or Visual Studio 2008

15. Select Tools > Visual Studio Command Prompt

16. In the command window change directory to the root of the Meazure source tree

17. The Meazure build uses the CMake program to configure the build environment.
    CMake can generate Makefiles and Visual Studio project files. To generate
    a build using Microsoft's NMake tool perform the following tasks at the
    root of the source tree:

        mkdir build-nmake
        cd build-nmake
        cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..

    To generate the solution and project files for Visual C++ Express 2010,
    perform the following tasks at the root of the source tree:

        mkdir build-vs10
        cd build-vs10
        cmake -G "Visual Studio	10" ..

    To generate a build for other environments issue the command "cmake --help"
    and select from the list of available generators.

18. To build Meazure using the Microsoft build tool nmake, change directories
    into the build-nmake directory created above and type nmake. The results
    are available in the directory build-nmake/Release. Note that it is not
    possible to build the debug configuration because the WINDK package does
    not provide debug versions of the MFC library.

19. To build Meazure using Visual C++ Express 2010, open the Meazure.sln file
    in the directory build-vs10 created above. The results are available in the
    directory build-vs10/Release

20. To run the unit tests run the following command from the root of the
    build tree (e.g. build-nmake):

        ctest

    To obtain more detail if a test fails, run:

        ctest -V

21. To create the Meazure installer, enter the build-nmake directory and issue
    the command:

        nmake dist

    The results are available in the dist top level directory.

22. The Meazure source code is heavily documented using the Doxygen comment
    syntax. The documentation corresponding to these comments has been
    generated and is available in the top level apidocs directory. To
    regenerate that documentation, change directories into the build-nmake
    directory and issue the command:

        nmake apidocs
