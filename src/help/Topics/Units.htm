        Meazure offers a variety of units in which to display linear and angular measurements
        each selected using the <span class="MenuItem">Units</span> menu. The linear units are
        used to measure positions, lengths and resolutions.
        <ul class="BulletList">
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Pixels</span> - Picture elements are the
                fundamental unit of measure available from Meazure.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Twips</span> - These units are typically used
                by programs such as Visual Basic when designing screen
                dialogs. One twip is equal to 1/1440 of an inch or 1/20
                of a point.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Points</span> - The point is most commonly
                used in typography to measure the height of characters in
                a font. One point is equal to 1/72 of an inch.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Picas</span> - One pica is equal to 12 points.
                Therefore, one pica is equal to 1/6 of an inch.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Inches</span> - Standard English unit of measure.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Centimeters</span> - Standard metric unit of
                measure. There are 2.54 centimeters to one inch.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Millimeters</span> - Standard metric unit of
                measure. There are 25.4 millimeters to one inch.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        Angles are measured using one of the following units.
        <ul class="BulletList">
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Degrees</span> - Measures between 0 and 360 degrees for
            a full circle.</li>
            <li><span class="LeadItem">Radians</span> - Measures between 0 and 2 * pi radians
            for a full circle.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        All linear units except pixels require Meazure to convert from pixels to
        the desired units using the screen resolution (dots per inch). For the conversion
        to be correct, the screen resolution values must be correct. By default, Meazure
        uses the screen resolution values reported by the Windows operating system. These
        values are not accurate. You should determine the true screen resolution using the
        <a href="Calibration.htm">Resolution Calibration dialog</a>. When you first select
        units that requires the use of the screen resolution, a dialog will be displayed
        urging you to calibrate Meazure.
        To learn more about the screen resolution see the
        <a href="Calibration.htm">Resolution Calibration</a> online help.
    </div>
    <div class="Para">
        A custom set of linear measurement units can be defined using the
        <a href="CustomUnits.htm">Custom Units</a> preferences. Once a set of custom units
        has been defined, it is displayed on and can be selected using the
        <span class="MenuItem">Units</span> menu.
