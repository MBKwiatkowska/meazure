    <div class="Para">
        There are two ways to save the position of a measurement tool: profiles and position logs. The
        one you choose depends on exactly what you are trying to save.

    <div class="SubSection">Profiles</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The positions and display characteristics of all <a href="ToolsOverview.htm">measurement tools</a>
        can be saved to a <a href="Profiles.htm">profile file</a>. These profiles
        can be loaded anytime to restore the configuration of all measurement tools. In addition,
        a profile can be specified to be <a href="AdvancedPrefs.htm">automatically loaded</a> when
        Meazure is started.
    </div>
    
    <div class="SubSection">Position Logs</div>
    <div class="Para">
        The position of the current measurement tool can be recorded in a
        <a href="PositionLogging.htm">position log</a>. This log can be save to a position log file.
        A position log file differs from a <a href="Profiles.htm">profile file</a> in the following way.
        A profile file is designed to save a complete snapshot of the Meazure program. That is, all tool
        positions, appearance settings, calibrations, and all other preferences are saved in a profile file.
        In contrast, a position log file records the position of the current measurement tool at a point in
        time and includes only those supporting items necessary to replay the positions.
